- Alguns time-aware podem ter sido classificados como POI rec. erroneamente.
- nao foi feito uma coluna para utilização de dados sendo como imagem. ????problemas
- existe algum artigo falando que usa informação social porem err.????? talvez. Errado somente se a popularidade de um poi não for uma info social.
- Desconsidere //a informação social se diferencia dependendo do alvo de recomendação (grupo ou individuo). Para um grupo as informações do grupo somente não são consideradas sociais.
